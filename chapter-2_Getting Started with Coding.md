### Writing Your First Program

Now that you have installed and set up the Koala development environment, and you have learned about some of the common libraries and modules that are available, you are ready to start writing your first program.

To write a Koala program, you need to create a new file using a text editor or code editor, and you need to save the file with a `.koa` file extension. For example, you could create a file called `hello.koa`, which would contain the code for your program.

Next, you need to write the code for your program. Koala programs are written in a high-level, human-readable language that is similar to English, and they use a simple and intuitive syntax that is easy to learn and use. Here is an example of a simple "Hello, World" program in Koala:

```javascript
# This is a simple "Hello, World" program in Koala.
# Import the standard "io" library, which provides input/output functions
import io

# Print the "Hello, World" message to the standard output stream
io.println("Hello, World")
```

This code defines a Koala program that uses the `io` library to print the "Hello, World" message to the standard output stream. The `import` statement is used to import the `io` library, and the `println` function is used to print the message to the console.

To run the program, you can use the Koala interpreter, which is included with the development environment. The interpreter is a program that reads your code, and it executes the instructions that you have written. To run the program, you can use the following command:

```shell
koa hello.koa
```
