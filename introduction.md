# Introduction to Coding and Computational Thinking

Coding and computational thinking are essential skills that are needed to understand and use computers and other digital technologies. Coding involves creating instructions for a computer to follow, using a programming language that the computer can understand. Computational thinking involves using logical and analytical thinking to solve problems and make decisions, using the same kinds of processes that a computer uses.

In this class, we will introduce you to the basics of coding and computational thinking, and help you develop the skills and concepts that are needed to write simple programs and solve problems using computers. You will learn about key concepts such as loops, variables, and algorithms, and how to use them to create programs that can solve real-world problems.

This class is designed for beginners, and no previous experience with coding or computers is required. We will start from the very beginning, and help you build a solid foundation of knowledge and skills that you can use to continue learning and exploring the world of coding and computational thinking.

By the end of this class, you will have a better understanding of what coding and computational thinking are, and how they can be used to solve problems and create new and exciting things. You will also have the basic skills and knowledge that you need to continue learning and exploring this fascinating field, and to pursue your own interests and passions in coding and computational thinking.
